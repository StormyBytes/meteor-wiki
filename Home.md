## Can I use Meteor on other Minecraft versions?
Meteor Client is written for the latest stable release of Minecraft.  
You can use [multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect) if you want to connect to servers running other versions of Minecraft.

## How do I open the GUI?
The default key is right shift. You can change this via the Minecraft controls menu by scrolling all the way to the bottom and changing it like any other key bind. Left click a module to toggle it and right click to open its settings page.  
There are many tabs at the top of the GUI that allow you to control other parts of Meteor such as configuration profiles and Baritone settings.

## Can I use Meteor with Optifine?
Optfine is not supported as it can cause many bugs with the client. Instead we recommend using [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) to improve your games performance.
Other Optifine alternatives can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).

## How can I use Baritone with Meteor?
Meteor comes with Baritone built in, this way we can integrate Baritone's features into many of Meteor's features.
Baritone's default command prefix is `#`, you can view all of Baritones commands [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/USAGE.md).
