# **Meteor Client** is a fabric utility mod for Minecraft 1.16 *(currently 1.16.3-4)*

### How to install:
1. Download the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) and install it or use [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download) and create a new instance and install fabric using the built in installer.
2. Download the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) and put it in your mods folder.
3. Download Meteor Client [Stable](https://meteorclient.com/) [Dev](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/756782622662721536) and put it in your .minecraft/mods folder (If the dev link doesn't work join the [Discord server](https://meteorclient.com/discord)).

### How do I use the client?
If you want to open the GUI, the default key is `RIGHT_SHIFT`. You can change this via the Minecraft controls menu by scrolling all the way to the bottom and changing it like any other key bind. Once open you can right click all of the headings to open and close all the categories. The same can be done for all the modules to access their settings.

### Can i use this client on versions other than 1.16.3?
Meteor Client is only made for minecraft version 1.16.3 (or the latest version if this guide is outdated when reading).
You can use [Multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect) if you want to connect to servers running older versions of minecraft

### Can i use optifine?
Optfine is not supported as it can cause many bugs with the client. Instead we recommend using [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium), [Phosphor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor) and [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) to improve your games performance.

### Does this client come with baritone?
Meteor Client has [Fabritone](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/fabritone) (the fabric fork of [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone)) built in.
Fabritone's default prefix is `@` but in Meteor Client you can use the `.b` command. Visit the [Docs](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/USAGE.md) for usage help.

### Reporting bugs/issues
