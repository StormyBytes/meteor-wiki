The default key for opening the GUI is <kbd>Right Shift</kbd> which you can change this via the Minecraft controls menu.
Inside the GUI, you can left click on a Module to toggle it and right click to configure its settings.

## How do I use the HUD?

**Turn on the HUD Module**
- Activate the HUD Module in the render category.

A red highlight on the hud element indicates that they are **OFF**. Simply left click to toggle and right click to configure.

## How do I import and export configs?
You can use Copy Paste shortcuts in the GUI to copy and paste configs.
- Windows and Linux: `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`
- MacOS: `Cmd + C` and `Cmd + V`

You can also use this feature in individual modules and individual tabs (GUI, Config, HUD, etc).

## Can someone give me a config?
Do not ask this in the meteor discord or to staff members, we do NOT provide configs. 

## How do I use Meteor on older Minecraft versions
Meteor is written for the latest stable release of Minecraft.

## How to use Meteor with Optifine?
Optifine is not and never will be supported by Meteor. We recommend using these instead,

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) | Performance improvements (better than Optifine)
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) | Server optimisations
- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) | Lighting engine improvements
- [Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) | Shader support and bundled Sodium

More alternatives and the reason why its not supported [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).

## How do I use Baritone with Meteor?
Meteor comes with Baritone built in, you don't need to download a standalone baritone.
Baritone's default command prefix is `#` or you can use the Meteor command `.b`.
You can view all of Baritone's commands [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/USAGE.md)
and settings [here](https://baritone.leijurv.com/baritone/api/Settings.html).

## How do I dupe with Meteor?
Finding dupes isn't an easy task. Public dupes get patched very quickly so alot of dupes are kept private.
For this reason, Meteor has no built in duping modules/features.

## Why can't I talk in the Meteor Discord?
You may have broken one of the rules in the [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/816501672477720626/) channel
and have been muted by staff.

If you did not break a rule, then [this](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/689198722097348624/870066829622652989) might explain why.
Due to the amount of users in the discord server increasing, public channels have been closed to only users who have roles. You can get a role by creating an account [here](https://meteorclient.com/account).

## How to use the proxy system?
It works just like a normal socks proxy. If you don't know what a proxy is, then I suggest you [google it](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=proxy) and find out.

## I am having problems installing this client
You may be having the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or JNI error if you tried running the jar file,
Meteor is a **Fabric Mod**. You aren't supposed to run the jar file, you are supposed to put it in your mods folder.
For complete instructions, refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client/wiki/Installation) manuals.
