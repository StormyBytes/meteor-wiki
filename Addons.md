Meteor has a built-in addon system which allows creation of addons.
Addons can modify almost anything in meteor, modules, commands, gui, etc.

There is no offical way to find/download addons although it is planned for the future.

*If you would like to try making your own addon, check out this [template](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-addon-template).*
