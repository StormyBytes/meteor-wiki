## Misc

- [Multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect) | Allows you to connect to older minecraft versions. Very useful since Meteor only supports latest versions.

- [ClientCommands](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/clientcommands) | Duplicates few features from Meteor Client, but also contains useful features, like cracking [rng](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/clientcommands/wiki/rng) seed or printing entity data
- [SeedMapper](https://github.com/xpple/SeedMapper) | Adds useful tools that use world seed

## Meteor Addons

Meteor has a built-in addon system which allows creation of addons.
Addons can modify almost anything in meteor, modules, commands, gui, etc.

You can check out this unofficial addons list [here](https://anticope.ml/pages/MeteorAddons.html).

## Incompatibilities

Meteor is a fabric mod, and like any other fabric mod, it can have incompatibilities.
Here are some of the mods known to be incompatible or cause issues with Meteor.

**Clients**
- [Inertia Client](https://inertiaclient.com/)
- [Wurst Client](https://www.wurstclient.net/)
- [Aristois Client](https://aristois.net/)


**Others**
- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) or [Optifabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric) | As stated [above](#optifine-alternatives), Optifine is and never will be compatible with Meteor.
- [Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com/) | Only crashes when opening the replay list. Recording should still be fine.
